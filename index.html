								The primary goal of Shopify is to simplify the process of running an online store for both small and large merchants. 
								Shopify prides itself in prioirtizing the people who use the platform by having award winning customer service that is available 24/7 for live chats, phones, emails, tweets and on the Shopify Community site.

						<h2>My Role at Shopify</h2>
						<p>
							In my role as a Junior Support Advisor (also known as Support Apprentice), I was exposed to an astronomical amount of information. Not only was I given training on the 
							ins and outs of the Shopify platform but I was also provided insight on third-party platforms such as domain providers, shipping carriers, apps, themes and so much more.
							<br><br>
							My role was to work the frontlines of the support team. I handled any and all questions imaginable from marketing, social media, and entrepreneurship to design and code customizations. 
							Not only that but I also handled merchant's frustrations and concerns regarding difficult conversations such as billing, chargebacks and account closures. Shopify provided me with all the 
							tools and resources necessary to not only solve the initial problem the customer had but also be proactive to prevent future questions and concerns so that they don't have to keep reaching out.
							<br>
							One of the main takeaways I took from experienced members of the Support Team was: <blockquote>We are teaching merchants to fish, we aren't handing them the fish</blockquote>
							
							My favourite part of the job was being constantly exposed to countless people from within Shopify to business owners that all provided unique perspectives. I was put in a unique situation 
							in that I saw all sides of Shopify including all aspects of the platform, third-party platforms that use Shopify, internal systems and how all of this impacts users. My absolute favourite aspect 
							of the job was the satisfaction of helping people. Seeing how happy, and often relived, they were made my day.

						<h2>Progress of my Goals and Feedback</h2>
						<p>
							I personally thrive on feedback, which is why one of my favourite practices that Shopify follows is providing live coaching and 1:1 meetings. Within these sessions 
							I was given direct feedback on my performance with the intent of just making my interactions that much better. Below is the feedback I received over the course of my time at Shopify.

							<h2>How Shopify Relates to my Studies</h2>
							<p>
								I am currently studying computer science and working for a large technology company like Shopify helped give me insight into the inner workings of what I was studying 
								academically and allowing me to apply my knowledge. The Univeristy of Guelph gave me the knowledge of good programming practices, how to read and undertand code. Through Shopify, I not 
								only was given the ability to gain knowledge of the platform, its languages and features, but also how I could help others apply everything and accomplish what the customer desires to do.

									<h3>Written Communication</h3>
									<p>
										Being able to communicate technical information clearly to a variety of skill levels is something that is crucial in the technical industry. This co-op job has allowed
										me to experience I vast difference in technical skill levels and I have had to communicate with all of them. Written communication is something that is necessary within both
										the academic and the professional realms. Shopify has helped me learn how to accurately communicate information which will enhance my documentation within my code.

									<h3>Technical Problems</h3>
									<p>
										Throughout my academic career, I have always been challenged with technical questions and problems to solve. Working with Shopify has only increased the amount of problems I am 
										exposed to, which I absolutely love. Shopify has allowed me to really think about breaking down problems into bite-sized pieces so that I fully understand the context of the issue 
										I'm faced with and then solving it step by step. I've been exposed to countless problems, each with a unique and tailored solution. This is a major takeaway that I will be bringing 
										over to my academic world as it will help me solve error messages, pinpoint solutions and breakdown major questions.
									</p>
								</section>
								<!-- Study 3 -->
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-user-friends" style="color:#DDBEB5;"></span>
									<h3>Team Work</h3>
									<p>
										During the last week I was with Shopify, I participated in an event called the Business Experience. It is a two-day event where students are put into random groups and given a 
										business question to solve. Each group creates a dedicated presentation which proposes to solve a problem. Team work is a vital element of this project and this experience 
										encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and take on more of a leadership role. I needed to manage time, resources and ideas so that we could present to a panel of judges.
										Academically, this experience will help me in future group projects so that my ideas can be heard.
