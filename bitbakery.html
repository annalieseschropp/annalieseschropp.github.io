						<h2>My Role at BitBakery</h2>
						<p>
                            Throughout my time with BitBakery, I was given the opportunity to work on a couple different projects. This included following the complete development lifecycle for one 
                            client as well as delving into researching a brand new project for another.
                            <br><br>
                            My role as an Application Software Developer at BitBakery exposed me to completely new experiences and technologies. As a coop student I am often unable to see projects from start to finish, 
                            however this position allowed me to experience everything from sprint 1 to final testing. From researching external providers to development to QA, I was exposed to all aspects of the project.
                            I was given several opportunities to present research findings, provide my opinions, and demonstrate my work to receive feedback.
                            <br><br>
                            I primarily worked on the development of a new product. This entailed using React Typescript with a Lambda Serverless backend and more to create a bridge between users and an external system to 
                            streamline their workflow. Since this was a brand new product and prior to this role I had little experience using this tech stack, I developed my skills as I became more familiar with the tools. 
                            Due to client confiendtiality, I am unable to explain in detail the specifics of the project.
                            <br><br>
                            Following that, I began another project. This entailed researching viable external providers to help narrow down the scope, creating and presenting a proof of concept, and general project structure 
                            setup. In my experience coop students are not typically given tasks related to the earliest stages of projects, so this was a very unique role for me.

						<h2>Progress of my Goals and Feedback</h2>
                        <p>
                            I personally thrive on feedback, which is why one of my favourite experiences I took from working at BitBakery was the one on one meetings with my supervisor Daniel. During these 
                            conversations, we were able to speak regarding the progress of the projects and my work itself. I found that within these meetings my opinion and ideas were taken into serious
                            consideration.  
                            <br><br>
                            During my final evalutation, I recieved feedback regarding confidence in group discussions. It was said that though I have the knowledge base and understanding to provide value to 
                            large meeting discussions, I find myself holding back in these conversations. I plan on taking this feedback and applying it towards future roles and academic terms in order to 
                            gain more confidence in my abilities.

						<h2>How BitBakery Relates to my Academics</h2>
						<p>
                            I am currently studying computer science and working as a developer helped give me insight into the inner workings of what I was studying 
                            academically and allowing me to apply my knowledge as well as develop new skills. Through BitBakery, I not only was given the opportunity to gain knowledge 
                            of new tools and languages, but I also learned how the research and early stages of a project can be accomplished.

                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Applying Technical Knowledge</b><br>
                                    Prior to this coop experience, I had completed the Cloud Computing course. It provided me a general knowledge base for working with cloud databases and functions at a 
                                    small scale. Through this role I was able to expand on that experience and apply it on a much larger scale. Without the original exposure to this, I would have felt 
                                    more overwhelmed, however the University of Guelph prepared me to understand the very basics of cloud technologies.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Research</b><br>
                                    Researching is a fundamental skill that anyone in a developer role must have. Throughout my education, I have honed this skill and in this role I was able to apply 
                                    that knowledge. From helping decide the best authentication provider to researching various external APIs, being able to read documentation and understand it 
                                    is a necessary strength to have both professionally and academically. 
								</p>
								<p>
                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Communication</b><br>
                                    It's extremely important to communicate clearly both verbally and in writing. Through my experiences in group projects, and in other positions, good communication prevents confusion 
                                    and fosters understanding. This is why there is emphasis within academic settings on clear communication. Especially in a virtual setting, communication is key in having the project 
                                    run smoothly and minimize wasted time. The University of Guelph prepared me for this while BitBakery allowed me to put it in practice.

						<h2>My Focus and Main Takeaways <br>from BitBakery</h2>
						<p>
                            The main takeaway I had working for BitBakery was the work. I found that this position was exactly what I could see myself doing post graduation. Not only did I have the 
                            opportunity to work on multiple projects but I continued to be exposed to new technologies. I felt as though the contributions I made to the projects actually had an impact 
                            and being able to see my work front and center fulfills me greatly. 
                            <br><br>
                            Not only was the work fulfilling but the people behind the company provide such a wonderful atmosphere. Being a small company creates a tightly knitted community that helps 
                            foster teamwork. I could reach out to anyone for help and similarly could provide assistance when needed. I felt welcomed and a part of the team during my coop with BitBakery.

						<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
						<p>
							Working for BitBakery has been a wonderful experience. I learned so much during my time with them that I will take with me into future jobs such as teamwork, communication, and 
                            creative thinking. Not only did this co-op opportunity provide me with help towards my desired goals, but they also gave me insight into what it would be like working as a developer.
                            <br><br>
                            I hope to return to BitBakery post graduation because of the community and the extremely unique and interesting projects.
