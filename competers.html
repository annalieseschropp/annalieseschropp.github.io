						<h2>My Role at Competers</h2>
						<p>
                            Throughout my time at Competers, I was given the opportunity to work on a many different projects. This included refactoring existing tools, creating new ones, redesigning entire products and more.
                            <br><br>
                            My role as a UX/UI Designer with Competers allowed me to delve into a completely new side of web development that I had not had the opportunity to explore until now. As a designer, I worked primarily with 
                            Adobe XD and created both low fidelity and high fidelity wireframes for both presentation and implementation purposes. Specifically, I designed Google Material Angular components to match the brand 
                            guidelines of the company. I also redesigned the current mobile app to utilize angular components and allow for swift development. Additionally, I created mockups for future products as well as small 
                            changes to existing tools.
                            <br><br>
                            When I was not designing, I was given the opportunity to develop. I primarily worked in Angular 9 and implemented the approved designs I created. In addition to that, I also took it upon myself to develop 
                            a reference site so that developers in the future could easily pull the desired angular component appearance quickly, without having to comb through any code.

						<h2>Progress of my Goals and Feedback</h2>
                        <p>
                            I personally thrive on feedback, which is why one of my favourite experiences I took from working at Competers was the many meetings in which I was given the opportunity to showcase my designs to my 
                            manager Shuaib Solker, or to others within the team, and recieve immediate feedback on the work I had completed.
                            <br><br>
                            During my mid-term check in, I received the feedback from both my manager, Shuaib Solker, and the CTO, Greg Hart, that the main thing I should work on was improving my initative in showcasing design ideas. 
                            I really tried to focus on this during the rest of my time with Competers when I had the opporunity to do so. I believe that I have improved in this area as I successfully began several major discussions on which design 
                            would lead to the best result from both a user and a developer perspective.

						<h2>How Competers Relates to my Academics</h2>
						<p>
                            I am currently studying computer science and working as a designer helped give me insight into a different avenue of what I was studying academically. I was able to apply my knowledge of how designs could 
                            be implemented prior to creating the design so I knew what would be easy to implement and what would be challenging. Not only did I use my academics to infulence how I designed but it also helped me pick 
                            up new technologies more quickly and allowed for me to develop new skills. Through Competers, I not only was given the opportunity to gain knowledge of new tools, but I also learned the best design practices.

                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Using Industry Standard Tools</b><br>
                                    It's extremely important to use standard tools, such as Adobe XD, correctly as it improves efficiency and quaility of designs. We are exposed to these tools at a smaller scale throughout our education 
                                    (i.e. CIS*3750), which has helped greatly when transitioning to a professional environment, using these tools at length. The University of Guelph prepared me for the use of these tools and Competers 
                                    helped expand my knowledge.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Communication</b><br>
                                    Being able to communicate technical information clearly to a variety of skill levels is something that is crucial in the technical industry. In this role I had to communicate technical points and 
                                    ideas to the marketing team so they understood what was possible for the developers to do while also communicating designs with developers so they knew how to correctly implement them. Having the 
                                    ability to shift the type of language one uses to help other understand is something necessary within both the academic and the professional worlds. The University of Guelph prepared me for this 
                                    while Competers allowed me to put it in practice.

                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Apply the Development Lifecycle</b><br>
                                    In the technology industry, we are taught very early on the importance of the development lifecycle. Whether it be agile, waterfall or some other form, every company uses one. That is why it is crucial to be 
                                    able to apply the development lifecycle both academically and professionally. While in most development roles designing is not something that we would normally have the opportunity to sink our teeth into but I 
                                    was given the opporunity to. In this role, I saw the full development cycle in action from designing, implementing, testing and more.

						<h2>My Focus and Main Takeaways <br>from Competers</h2>
						<p>
                            The people and community at Competers are what make it such a good company to work for. While I did not have the pleasure of spending ample time with the other teams outside of the developers, those 
                            who I did speak to regularly I developed bonds with. Not only was everyone extremely welcoming and friendly, but they were quick to answer any questions I had and they were easily accessible despite this 
                            being a remote role.
                            <br><br>
                            In addition to the people at Competers, the role itself was extremely enlightening. I was given the opportunity to delve into a field that I had very little experience in and I was able to learn a lot from 
                            it. I learned that designing is not something that I would personally pursue as a full-time career, however perhaps a combination of bothe design and development would be a good fit. I am glad I decided to 
                            take a chance and try something new as I have learned that strictly designing is not something that truly drives me, but development is.

						<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
						<p>
							Working for Competers has been an experience I won't soon forget. I learned so much during my time with the team that I will take with me into future jobs such as learning how to design, communicate my ideas to a variety 
                            of audiences, and thinking creatively. Not only did this co-op opportunity provide me with help towards my desired goals, but they also gave me insight into what it would be like working as a designer.
