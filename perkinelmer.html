							<p>
                                Perkin Elmer is transforming the pharmaceutical industry with advanced clinical analytics solutions. Their software enables researchers to discover new drug 
                                therapies more efficiently and pinpoint safety issues quickly. Perkin Elmer's work helps people get access to critical drug therapies more quickly compared to 
                                traditional approaches.
                                <br><br>
                                The Guelph Perkin Elmer team focuses on building web solutions for Clinical products using cloud platforms, big data technologies and visual analytics tools.

					<div class="content">
						<h2>My Role at Perkin Elmer</h2>
						<p>
                            Throughout my time at Perkin Elmer, I was given the opportunity to work on a few different projects. This included maintaining an existing product by fixing bugs and starting 
                            a brand new product for the company. 
                            <br><br>
                            My role as a Full Stack Developer at Perkin Elmer allowed me to take on unique product and experience the development lifecycle from multiple perspectives. 
                            I was able to sit in on meetings in which the ideation process was discussed, I was able to build solutions and reusable components for the future of the product, and also 
                            was able to demo my work and receive feedback. 
                            <br><br>
                            I primarily worked on the development of one of Perkin Elmerâ€™s new products. It entailed using C#, Python and more to create an inutive solution for medical reviewers to utilize TIBCO Spotfire
                            visualization services to streamline their workflow. The project was extremely interesting to work on and I'm very excited to see how it turns out in the future as it develops 
                            further.
                            <br><br>
                            Since this was a brand new product and prior to this role I had never used C#, Python, or Spotfire, I was given training through Perkin Elmer and also developed my skills as 
                            I became more familiar with the tools while working on the project.

						<h2>Progress of my Goals and Feedback</h2>
                        <p>
                            I personally thrive on feedback, which is why one of my favourite experiences I took from working at Perkin Elmer was meetings in which I was given the opportunity to 
                            demonstrate my work to the rest of the team, or people outside of the team, and recieve immediate feedback on the work I had done.
                            <br><br>
                            During my mid-term check in, I received the feedback from my supervisor, Tim Cooper, that the main thing I should work on was improving my confidence when presenting my 
                            work to the team. I really tried to focus on this during the rest of my presentations and took initative to lead the conversation in project meetings. I believe that I have 
                            improved in my presenation skills as I feel more comfortable articulating my work.
                            <br><br>
                            One of my goals during this work term was to communicate clearly through pull requests and JIRA tickets, so that anyone would be able to understand what I completed. 
                            I reached out to Harry, who is a senior developer at Perkin Elmer, to see how I was doing in this regard as he reviewed all of my pull requests. He stated that my pull request notes  
                            were "the best [he] had seen".
                            <br><br>
                            INSERT FUTURE FEEDBACK HERE.

						<h2>How Perkin Elmer Relates to my Academics</h2>
						<p>
                            I am currently studying computer science and working as a developer helped give me insight into the inner workings of what I was studying 
                            academically and allowing me to apply my knowledge as well as develop new skills. Through Perkin Elmer, I not only was given the opportunity to gain knowledge 
                            of new tools and languages, but also how I learned industry standard practices.
						</p>
						<main>
							<div class="timeline">
								<p>
                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Working as a Team</b><br>
                                    I think that one of the most important skills to learn is how to work as a team. Not only was I able to experience working in close-knit group with one other 
                                    developer but I was also able to work in a slightly larger group for feedback and direction. Being able to communicate clearly and effectively is necessary in 
                                    both academically and professionally and this is a skill I have improved upon greatly over this coop. I will be taking this skill with me in my next academic semester.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Working on Large Scale Projects</b><br>
                                    Prior to this coop experience, I had not yet worked on any projects of this scale. It's imperative as we progress in our education that we are able to adapt and not 
                                    become overwhelmed with large projects. I feel as though through Perkin Elmer, I am more comfortable with larger projects as I learned to break down big problems into 
                                    smaller, more manageable pieces.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    <b style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#273765;">Using Industry Standard Tools</b><br>
                                    It's extremely important to use standard tools, such as GitHub, correctly. We are exposed to these tools at a smaller scale throughout our education, which has 
                                    helped greatly when transitioning to a professional environment, using these tools at length. The University of Guelph prepared me for the use of these tools and 
                                    Perkin Elmer helped expand my knowledge.

						<h2>My Focus and Main Takeaways <br>from Perkin Elmer</h2>
						<p>
                            The people and community at Perkin Elmer are what make it such a good company to work for. One would think with the shift towards everyone working remotely, 
                            that it would be more difficult to form bonds with your team or communicate in general. This was not the case at Perkin Elmer, I met an amazing group of people that were 
                            all extremely friendly and helpful. 
                            <br><br>
                            Another takeaway I had working for Perkin Elmer was the work itself. This position was extremely unique, and I was able to work on fascinating projects that I feel I never would have 
                            before. I was exposed to technology that pharmaceutical companies use on a daily-basis and I was able to work on products that will be put into production. Perkin Elmer ensures that the 
                            work everyone, including the students, do is meaningful.

						<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
						<p>
							Working for Perkin Elmer has been a fantastic experience. I learned so much during my time with them that I will take with me into future jobs such as teamwork, communication, and 
                            creative thinking. Not only did this co-op opportunity provide me with help towards my desired goals, but they also gave me insight into what it would be like working as a developer.
                            <br><br>
                            I would love to return to Perkin Elmer in any capacity for both the community and the extremely unique and interesting projects.
